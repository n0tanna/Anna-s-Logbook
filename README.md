# Geolibrum

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Since this bot has a docker-compose file, all you need to start your own Geolibrum locally is:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
or
```
docker-compose down ; docker-compose build ; docker-compose up
```
while being in the root directory of project.
